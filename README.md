# Music Store

## Description
This OOP project is about the organisation of a music instruments store, having to hit different points:
- two design patterns
- one template function
- one template class
- upcasting
- dynamic cast
- virtual function
- virtual constructors/destructors
- copy constructor and overloading = operator
- exceptions: minimum two classes derived from ```std::exception``` for errors( using ```throw``` in constructor/ ```try/catch``` in main)
- STL
- using ```const``` as much as possible

## Machine
- MacOS
- CLion 2022.3.2
